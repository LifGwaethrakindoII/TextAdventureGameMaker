This is the base class:\n\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\nnamespace Voidless.TextAdventureMaker\n{\npublic enum NodeType { Undefined, Dialogue, Condition, Connection, Setter, Selector, Sequencer }\n\npublic enum NodeResult { Undefined, Success, Running, Failure, Error }\n\n[Serializable]\npublic abstract class TextAdventureNode\n{\n    public ConnectionNode connectionNode;\n    public DialogueNode dialogueNode;\n    public ConditionNode conditionNode;\n    public SetterNode setterNode;\n    public TextAdventureNode next;\n\n    /// <returns>Node Type.</returns>\n    public abstract NodeType GetNodeType();\n\n    /// <summary>Sets Next Node.</summary>\n    /// <param name=\"node\">Next Node</param>\n    public void SetNextNode(TextAdventureNode node)\n    {\n        if (node == null) return;\n\n        next = node;\n        connectionNode = null;\n        dialogueNode = null;\n        conditionNode = null;\n        setterNode = null;\n\n        switch (node.GetNodeType())\n        {\n            case NodeType.Dialogue:\n                dialogueNode = node as DialogueNode;\n            break;\n\n            case NodeType.Condition:\n                conditionNode = node as ConditionNode;\n            break;\n\n            case NodeType.Connection:\n                connectionNode = node as ConnectionNode;\n            break;\n\n            case NodeType.Setter:\n                setterNode = node as SetterNode;\n            break;\n\n            case NodeType.Undefined:\n            default:\n                Debug.Log(\"Node with uncompatible node type \" + node.GetNodeType().ToString() + \" was provided.\");\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public TextAdventureNode(TextAdventureNode node)\n    {\n        SetNextNode(node);\n    }\n\n    /// <summary>Excecutes Node.</summary>\n    public virtual NodeResult Excecute()\n    {\n        switch (next.GetNodeType())\n        {\n            case NodeType.Dialogue:     return dialogueNode.Excecute();\n            case NodeType.Condition:    return conditionNode.Excecute();\n            case NodeType.Connection:   return connectionNode.Excecute();\n            case NodeType.Undefined:\n            default:                    return NodeResult.Error;\n        }\n    }\n}\n}\n\n3.-A Blackboard sounds like a good idea.
